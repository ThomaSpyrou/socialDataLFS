# socialDataLFS

This repository is about the final project of the the DTU course Social data analysis and visualization (02806). 
In this project will try to explore data about wildfires, deforestation, agriculture development and animal extinction in 
areas that were affected from wildfires. The main country that we will focus is Brazil and the Amazon Rainforest.
